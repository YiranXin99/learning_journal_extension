Learning journal extension
=========
This is an extension to quickly copy what you need from other folders to the central folder.
You need to do it through the combination of shortcut keys and toolbar buttons. Also open the files you need (including several notebook source files and a central file) and keep them running. Also, before the file is initialized, some cells with content are automatically loaded as descriptions, and you can choose to delete them if you don't need them.

Copy function:
-------------
 Click on each cell you want to copy and mark it with “control+e” on your keyboard. After all the selection is complete, you can click the button below to complete the copy operation.

Open your central notebook, if it is an empty file we will load some cells with explanations by default. Click the button below to paste into the central notebook with one click.
